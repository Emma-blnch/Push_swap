## üè∑Ô∏è **About the project**
> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you‚Äôll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

This project is about sorting data on a stack by coding a performant sorting algorithm.

## üì• **What I learned**
Skills I developed with this project:
- [x] *Unit testing* : separare test for each function (test one function after it is done and once again when another function is done to make sure they still work together).
- [x] *Critical thinking* : assess the effectiveness of solutions (algorithms) and adjust accordingly.
- [x] *Competitive spirit* : boosting performance for optimal sorting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical skills I acquired**
- [x] Analyze and optimize performance
- [x] Algorithmic complexity
- [x] Handling data structures
